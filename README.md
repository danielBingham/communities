# Communities 

Communities is a user-supported social media platform that is working towards
becoming a non-profit, multi-stakeholder cooperative. It's a democratically
governed social network build to support democracy.

Communities is currently in Open Beta. You're welcome to use it, but it's not
finished and there will still be some bugs.

Platform: https://communities.social

## Contributing

Communities is not currently well setup to accept contributions.  Our local is
highly coupled with our cloud infrastructure and we don't have the bandwidth to
de-couple it just now. 

However, if you are interest in contributing, there are two projects you could
work on that would be really helpful:

* Decouple the local from our cloud infrastructure in a configurable way.
* Review and audit the code for security issues.  If you find any, open an issue or PR!
